# Natural-Agile
_BEing Agile is different to DOing Agile - this space is to invite a collective of people to share what ideas helped them to BE agile in their business/ technology._


Lets build out some files on the core things that help with BEing agile. To be clear this is not about processes and tools like ceremonies and jira, this is about values and sharing learning from fails and wins alike that enabled you to achieve business and/or technological agility (i.e. the ability to respond to change).

- adapting to change
- building the right things first
  - delivering earlier
  - making feedback loop smaller
  - effective prioritization
  - understanding value more clearly
- creating better quality software
- removing friction
- continuous improvement
  - efficiency
  - reducing waste
- the art of simplicity
- Culture
  - fostering innovation
  - fun at work
  - positive interactions
  - good team/ org dynamics & customer relationships

**Dual purpose**
You might be thinking that this could be simpler on another tool, and that brings me to the dual purpose of this repo: Scrum Master's and Agile practitioners to get an introduction to Github.

There are many networks of Scrum Masters out there, so invite people to come and find this repo and try Github out, especially if they have not worked as an engineer before but now work on a Scrum team with engineers.

This is something that Scrum is widely criticized for today, but the more SM's can empathise with devs via understanding their day to day flow, the more able they might be to get to the core of some communication problems and bring some meaningful help to developers.

Learning this in a contribute-to-learn environment that's content is about the values of agile rather than the frameworks, will hopefully encourage us towards bottom-up-itelligence originated ideas for agile discussions at work - I hope.
